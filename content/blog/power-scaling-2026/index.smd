## The Year Ahead

This year I plan to really level up as developer by tackling
a progressively more difficult list of projects in the networking
and distibuted system space. Each of these projects was chosen to 
go deeper on core concepts in computer science and not meant to
teach any specific tool

## Readings

- Designing Data Intensive Applications
- beej's socket guide 
- computer networking a top down approach

## Projects

- Echo Server
- Web Server
- LC3 VM
- Rate Limiter
- Load Balancer 
- Redis or Memcached
- NATS
- Uptime Monitoring 
- Bitcask

## URL Shortener Capstone

2026 will conclude with a system design and implementation 
of a URL Shortener.
