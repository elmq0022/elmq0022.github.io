## About Me
Hi, I'm Aaron. These days I'm a sofware enginer developer.
I've learned a lot on my own, but I've also had a couple outstanding mentors.

## About My Goals
When in comes to softwared I want to know what's under the hood.
So, I've decide to a pick a progression of projects for the year 
and to document what I leared from them here.

## About Elmquist.dev
Elmquist.dev is the site where I document my journey though software.
This site mainly exist as a means for me to document my thoughts
and learning from various software projects.

This site is created using the zine static site generator and
hosted on github pages. 

The theme is, for now, a straight up copy of the [zine site](https://zine-ssg.io/).
