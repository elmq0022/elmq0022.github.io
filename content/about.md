## About Me
Hi, I'm Aaron. These days I'm a sofware enginer developer.
I've learned a lot on my own, but I've also had a couple outstanding mentors.

## About My Goals
When in comes to softwared I want to know what's under the hood.
So, I've decide to a pick a progression of projects for the year
and to document what I leared from them here.

## About Elmquist.dev
Elmquist.dev is the site where I document my journey though software.
This site mainly exist as a means for me to document my thoughts
and learning from various software projects.

This site is created using Hugo with the Coder theme and
hosted on GitHub Pages.
