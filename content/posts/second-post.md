This second post is mainly here to show you that you can also create single file
posts for convenience. The first post contains more interesting content.

Btw this sample website also includes the JS/CSS dependencies required to render
math:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(\omega) \cdot (-1)^{2 \omega t} \mathrm{d}\omega \\
F(\omega) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) \div (-1)^{2 \omega t} \mathrm{d}t \\
\end{aligned}
$$

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!
</div>

This: $(-1)^x = \cos(\pi x) + i\sin(\pi x)$ is an inline equation instead!
