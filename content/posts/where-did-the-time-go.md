## A Tough Realization

Towards the middle of 2025 I looked at a friend and mentor's GitHub commit history.
It was a wall of green.
Not for days or weeks or months but years.
Here I could clearly see the gap between us.
I went to look at my own commit history even though I didn't need to.
It was hard not to feel a little disappointed in myself for all that lost time.

## A New Philosophy

Here's how I'm going to close the gap.

### Focus on Fundamentals
Don't chase frameworks and shiny new technology.
Instead focus on the fundamentals of software engineering.

### Practice Consistently
Becoming a bit better every day is enough.
The small consistent gains will easily outperform my short infrequent bursts.

### Accept Realistic Expectations
I'm doing well, but I know I can do better.
It's time to green up that commit history.

## The Year Ahead (2026)

For 2026 I've put together a plan of progressively more difficult projects.
These projects mostly focus on small academic versions of the systems I use every day.
Completing and documenting these should deepen my understanding of the systems I rely on.

## Project Sequence

- [x] [Echo Server]({{< ref "echo-server" >}})
- [x] [Web Server]({{< ref "web-server" >}})
- [x] Rate Limiter
- [ ] Load Balancer
- [ ] Redis or Memcached
- [ ] NATS
- [ ] Uptime Monitoring
- [ ] Bitcask

## Capstone Project

The capstone of this sequence will conclude with the design and implementation of a URL Shortener.
This is the classic system design problem and seems deceptively simple on the surface.
However there is plenty to discuss here in terms of design and tradeoffs.
Working through the design and tradeoffs prior to implementation should strengthen 
my design skills significantly.
