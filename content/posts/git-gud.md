## Philosophy and Approach

Towards the middle of 2025 I looked at a friend and mentor's GitHub commit history.
It was a wall of green. 
Not for days or weeks or months but years.
Here I could clearly see the gap between us.
I went back through my own sporadic commit history and it was pathetic.

## My Five Rings of Programming
Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings is a treatise on how to prepare, how to engage, and how to win.
He stated that these principles apply to any craft pursued with mastery in mind.
Here's how I plan to apply these principles to the craft of software engineering. 

### Chi (Earth)
The Earth Ring discusses the need to focus on the fundamentals.
My efforts here are to find and close gaps in my fundamentals.

### Mizu (Water)
The Water Ring is all about being adaptable and fluid.
I've set a course for myself this year but will adapt to my own capabilities and reality.
Projects largely won't be "production" grade but will be what is needed to get a grasp of the fundamentals.

### Ka (Fire)
The Fire Ring teaches the importance of initiative in battle.
I am largely trying to find and extinguish gaps in my abilities. 

### Kaze (Wind)
Musashi studied many other sword schools and their techniques.
I typically use Python in my day job but will use Go in these projects to learn a different approach.

### Ku (Void)
I will practice and write about these projects such that I master them and the knowledge becomes internalized and intuitive.
